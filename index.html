<div class="container">
  <div class="div1" ><h3>Chicken</h3>I could tell you it sort of taste like turkey but a little less bland, but I'm going to take a wild guess and assume you haven't tasted turkey either. If you've never had meat in your mouth, I don't know how to describe it to you. Chicken tastes unlike any vegetable I've ever tasted.Chicken has comparatively little fat content compared to other meats, and thus, not as flavorful from a meaty flavor standpoint, but those words are also probably meaningless to you.Without any frame of reference or point of comparison, a verbal explanation is not going to prepare you for the experience. You're over thinking this.Take the plunge and jump into the water.f paneer had a baby with compressed flaky chocolate like stringiness and it was harder in texture, and mildly salty and mildly oily in taste, with the closest smelling vegetarian item probably being milk, it'd be close to chicken.When you put it in your mouth, its rubbery-paneerish on bite and can be chewed-eaten-swallowed like normal food, but if its cooked too much then it becomes like carpety-chewing-gum and hence hard to swallow.</div>
  <div class="div2" ><h3>Beef</h3> Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle.In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade. In the United States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner. Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.</div>
  <div class="div3" ><h3>Sushi</h3> Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called sumeshi. The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori.Sushi is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked. And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice. Regardless of the toppings or fillings, sushi always includes rice.As a matter of fact, sushi rice is so important that sushi chefs in Japan undergo years of training just to learn how to cook the rice properly, before they ever begin to handle any fish or seafood. </div>
